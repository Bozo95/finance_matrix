    st.markdown("""

    <p><i>The current ratio is one of the most fundamental liquidity ratios used in financial analysis. It measures a company‚Äôs ability to meet its short-term obligations with its short-term assets. In simple terms, it tells us whether a business has enough resources that can be quickly converted into cash to pay off debts and liabilities due within one year.</i></p>
     
    <p><i><b>Current assets</b> include cash, marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventory, and prepaid expenses-basically assets expected to be converted into cash or used up within a year.</i></p>

    <p><i><b>Current liabilities</b> consist of accounts payable, short-term debt, accrued expenses, taxes payable, and the current portion of long-term debt-obligations due within the same timeframe.</i></p>

    **Interpretation of the Current Ratio**
    
    - Ratio > 1: The company has more current assets than current liabilities and can generally meet its short-term obligations without liquidity issues.
    - Ratio = 1: Current assets exactly cover current liabilities. This is a borderline position where the company can just meet its short-term debts but has little margin for error.
    - Ratio < 1: The company may struggle to pay off its short-term debts, indicating potential liquidity problems. However, some businesses with fast inventory turnover or quick receivables collection can operate safely with ratios below 1.

    **Industry and Context Matter**
    
    The ‚Äúideal‚Äù current ratio varies by industry and business model.

    For example:
    
    <b>Retail companies</b> often have higher ratios due to significant inventory and cash holdings.
    <b>Service companies</b> may have lower ratios because they hold less inventory and have faster cash conversion cycles.
    Companies with strong cash flows and rapid receivables collection can afford lower current ratios without risking liquidity.

    **Limitations of the Current Ratio**
    
    It treats all current assets equally, but some (like inventory or prepaid expenses) may not be easily or quickly converted to cash.
    It provides a snapshot at one point in time and may not reflect seasonal fluctuations or timing differences in cash flows.
    It does not measure the quality of assets or liabilities, so a high ratio could sometimes indicate inefficient use of resources or excess idle cash.
    For a more conservative view of liquidity, analysts often use the quick ratio, which excludes inventory and prepaid expenses from current assets.

    **Why Is the Current Ratio Important?**
    
    1. <b>For creditors and lenders:</b> It indicates the company‚Äôs ability to repay short-term debts, influencing credit decisions and loan terms.
    2. <b>For management:</b> It helps monitor operational efficiency and working capital management, guiding decisions on inventory, receivables, and payables.
    3. <b>For investors:</b> It signals financial health and risk, affecting investment decisions and valuation.

with st.expander("üí∏ **DEBT TO EQUITY RATIO**", expanded=False):
    st.markdown("""

    <p><i>The debt-to-equity ratio (D/E) is a key financial metric used to evaluate a company‚Äôs financial leverage and capital structure. It measures the relative proportion of debt and equity that a company uses to finance its assets and operations.</i></p>
    

    **What Does the Debt-to-Equity Ratio Tell Us?**

    - The debt-to-equity ratio answers the question: ‚ÄúFor every dollar of equity contributed by shareholders, how many dollars of debt does the company have?‚Äù For example, a ratio of 2.0 means the company has 2 dollars of debt for every 1 dollar of equity.
    - A higher ratio indicates greater financial leverage (gearing), meaning the company relies more on borrowed funds. This can amplify returns during good times but also increases financial risk if earnings decline or cash flow tightens.
    - A lower ratio suggests a more conservative capital structure, with less reliance on debt and potentially lower financial risk, but possibly higher cost of capital since equity financing is often more expensive.

    **Why Is the Debt-to-Equity Ratio Important?**

    1. **Risk Assessment:** Creditors and investors use the D/E ratio to assess the company‚Äôs risk profile. A highly leveraged company may face difficulties meeting debt obligations during downturns, increasing the risk of insolvency.
    2. **Capital Structure Decisions:** Management uses this ratio to balance debt and equity financing, optimizing the cost of capital and financial flexibility.
    3. **Industry Context:** The "ideal" debt-to-equity ratio varies widely by industry. Capital-intensive sectors like utilities or telecommunications often operate with higher ratios, while technology or service companies tend to have lower ratios.


    **Key points for memorization**
    
    - The debt-to-equity ratio measures how a company finances its operations through debt versus equity.
    - It is a critical indicator of financial risk and leverage.
    - Interpretation depends on industry norms and company strategy.
    - A balanced ratio supports growth while managing risk; an excessively high ratio can signal financial distress.
    - Always consider this ratio alongside other financial metrics for a comprehensive analysis.
    - Understanding the debt-to-equity ratio equips you with insight into a company‚Äôs financial structure, risk exposure, and capital management strategy-essential knowledge for financial analysis and decision-making.

    <p><i>The net debt ratio is a key financial metric that measures a company‚Äôs overall indebtedness after accounting for its liquid assets, primarily cash and cash equivalents.</i></p>
    <p><i>It provides a clearer picture of the company‚Äôs true debt burden by subtracting highly liquid assets from total debt, reflecting how much debt would remain if the company used its cash reserves to pay down liabilities.</i></p>
    
    **What Does the Net Debt Ratio Tell Us?**

    The net debt ratio expresses net debt as a proportion of a relevant base, often total equity or EBITDA, to assess leverage and financial risk. It answers the question: After using all available cash, how much debt does the company still carry relative to its size or earnings?
    A low or negative net debt (where cash exceeds debt) indicates strong liquidity and financial flexibility. Such companies can easily cover their debts or even have surplus cash for investments.
    A high net debt signals greater leverage, implying higher financial risk and potential difficulty in meeting debt obligations during downturns.

    **Why Is the Net Debt Ratio Important?**

    1. **More Accurate Leverage Measure:** Unlike gross debt ratios, net debt accounts for cash reserves that could be used to pay down debt, providing a realistic view of financial obligations.
    2. **Liquidity Insight:** It shows how much debt remains after liquid assets are considered, helping assess the company‚Äôs ability to handle debt payments without raising additional funds.
    3. **Credit and Investment Decisions:** Lenders and investors use the net debt ratio to evaluate creditworthiness and financial stability, influencing borrowing costs and investment attractiveness.
    4. **Valuation and Enterprise Value:** Net debt is used in calculating enterprise value, which is crucial for mergers, acquisitions, and valuation analyses.

    **Key points for memorization**

    - The net debt ratio refines traditional debt measures by subtracting cash and equivalents from total debt.
    - It provides a realistic view of a company‚Äôs indebtedness and liquidity position.

    <p>A low or negative net debt ratio signals strong financial health, while a high ratio indicates greater leverage and risk.</p>
    <p>This ratio is vital for creditors, investors, and management to evaluate financial risk, borrowing capacity, and strategic decisions.
    Understanding the net debt ratio <b>equips you to analyze a company‚Äôs true leverage and financial resilience</b> beyond simple debt figures, making it an essential tool in financial analysis and corporate finance.</p>
