    <i>Equity represents the owners‚Äô residual interest in the company after all liabilities are deducted from assets. It includes shareholder contributions (paid-in capital), retained earnings, and reserves.</i>
    <p><i>By the type of the company, weather is it a private or a public company, equity composition varies. In private companies equity is held by a limited number of private investors or founders, often not publicly traded. Ownership changes are less liquid and more controlled.</i></p>
    <p><i>On the other hand in the public companies or also commonly reffered to as <b>Traded companies</b> equity is divided into shares traded on stock exchanges, accessible to the general public, with greater regulatory oversight and transparency.</i></p>

    **EQUITY RATIO**
    
    The equity ratio measures the proportion of a company‚Äôs assets financed by equity.
    A higher equity ratio indicates financial strength and lower reliance on debt.

    **Why Healthy Equity Matters**
    
    1. Strong equity provides a cushion against losses, supports borrowing capacity, and signals financial stability.
    2. Companies with weak equity are more vulnerable to financial distress.
    3. Leaving the companies more prone to the occurance of events like <b>Insolvency</b> or in sever case even <b>Banktrupcy</b>.
    
    A company becomes insolvent when it cannot meet its debt obligations or when liabilities exceed assets. Insolvency often leads to bankruptcy, where the company may be liquidated or restructured.

    <i>For a list of a specific requirements needed for a company to qualify as insolvent, look at your country's specific law that tackles that matter. In the USA, U.S. Code: Title 11 gives a complete overview on bankruptcy procedure.</i>.

    st.markdown("""

    <i>Long-term liabilities are financial obligations or debts that a company must pay off over a period longer than one year. Unlike short-term liabilities, which are due within 12 months, long-term liabilities extend beyond this timeframe and are crucial for financing a company‚Äôs long-term investments and growth.</i>

    
    <b>Think</b> of long-term liabilities as loans or debts that a company takes on to fund major purchases or projects, such as buying land, buildings, machinery, or expanding operations. Because these debts are paid back slowly over several years, they allow companies to invest in their future without immediately draining their cash reserves.

    **Common Examples of Long-Term Liabilities**
    
    1. **Long-Term Loans:** These are loans from banks or other lenders that must be repaid over multiple years. For example, a mortgage loan on a company‚Äôs office building might be repaid over 15 or 30 years.
    2. **Bonds Payable:** Companies may issue bonds to investors to raise capital. These bonds are promises to pay back the borrowed money with interest over a set period, often many years.
    3. **Pension Liabilities:** These represent the company‚Äôs obligations to pay retirement benefits to employees in the future.
    4. **Post-Retirement Healthcare Liabilities:** Some companies provide healthcare benefits to retired employees, creating long-term obligations.
    5. **Deferred Revenues:** Money received in advance for goods or services to be delivered in the future, beyond one year.
    6. **Provisions or Reservations:** These include estimated liabilities for employee benefits, warranties, or potential legal penalties that may arise over the long term.

    **Importance of Long-Term Liabilities**

    Long-term liabilities are essential because they help companies finance big investments without needing to pay everything upfront. By spreading payments over many years, companies can maintain liquidity and invest in growth. However, having too much long-term debt can increase financial risk, especially if the company struggles to generate enough cash flow to meet interest and principal payments.

    How Long-Term Liabilities Appear on the Balance Sheet

    On the balance sheet, liabilities are split into current (short-term) and long-term sections. Long-term liabilities are listed after current liabilities, ordered by their due dates. For example, a debt due in 18 months is listed before one due in 24 months.

    If any portion of a long-term liability is due within the next year, that portion is reclassified as a current liability to show the upcoming payment.

    **Key points for memorization**

    - Long-term liabilities are debts payable after one year.
    - They fund major investments and help companies grow without immediate cash outflows.
    - Examples include loans, bonds, pensions, and deferred revenues.
    - Proper management of long-term liabilities balances growth opportunities with financial risk.
    - Understanding these liabilities helps you assess a company‚Äôs long-term financial health and stability.

        <p> Things get complicated if company ecounters different market conditions that affect the cash flow generation ability of the company. In that case, L-T obligations/debt needs to be restructured ASAP, as company could face lack of short term liquidity.</p>

with st.expander("üí∏ **SHORT TERM LIABILITIES**", expanded=False):
    st.markdown("""

    <i>Short-term liabilities, also known as current liabilities, are financial obligations that a company must settle within one year or within its normal operating cycle, whichever is longer. These liabilities represent the company‚Äôs immediate debts and obligations that require prompt payment, often using current assets like cash or accounts receivable.</i>
    <i>Because these liabilities are due quickly, managing them effectively is crucial for maintaining liquidity and avoiding cash flow problems.</i>

    **Common Examples of Short-Term Liabilities**
    
    1. **Accounts Payable:** Money owed to suppliers for goods or services already received but not yet paid for. This is one of the most common short-term liabilities.
    2. **Accrued Expenses:** Expenses that have been incurred but not yet paid, such as wages, utilities, and interest.
    3. **Short-Term Loans:** Loans or credit lines that must be repaid within a year, often used to cover temporary cash shortages.
    4. **Current Portion of Long-Term Debt:** The part of long-term loans that must be paid within the next 12 months.
    5. **Taxes Payable:** Taxes due to government authorities within the year, including income taxes, sales taxes, or payroll taxes.
    6. **Unearned Revenue:** Payments received in advance from customers for goods or services that will be delivered within the year.
    7. **Dividends Payable:** Dividends declared by the company‚Äôs board but not yet paid to shareholders.

    **Importance of Short-Term Liabilities**
    
    Short-term liabilities are critical because they reflect the company‚Äôs immediate financial obligations. Proper management ensures the company can meet these obligations without disrupting operations or damaging relationships with suppliers and employees. Failure to manage short-term liabilities can lead to liquidity crises, forcing a company to take costly emergency measures or even risk insolvency.
    
    Short-term liabilities are listed under the current liabilities section of the balance sheet. They are typically ordered by due date, with the most urgent obligations listed first. This helps investors and creditors assess the company‚Äôs short-term financial health and liquidity.


     **Key points for memorization**
    
    - Short-term liabilities are debts due within one year.
    - They include accounts payable, accrued expenses, short-term loans, taxes, and unearned revenue.
    - Managing these liabilities effectively is essential to maintain liquidity and operational stability.
    - They appear as current liabilities on the balance sheet and are closely monitored through liquidity ratios.
    - Understanding short-term liabilities helps you evaluate a company‚Äôs ability to meet its immediate financial commitments.
